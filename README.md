# Motor-Controller-for-Different-Types-of-Motor

BLDC Motor – Trapezoidal Control: Designed and implemented a trapezoidal control algorithm using six-step commutation to drive a Brushless DC motor
PMSM Motor – Field-Oriented Control (FOC):Developed a high-performance vector control system for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors using Field-Oriented Control (FOC). The controller .
Induction Motor – V/F Control: Created a scalar control system based on the Volt/Hertz (V/F) method for Induction Motors. This controller provides open-loop speed control and is ideal for applications where simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness are prioritized over dynamic performance.
Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) – Angle Control with Hysteresis Current Control: Implemented an angle-based switching strategy integrated with hysteresis current control for SRMs.
